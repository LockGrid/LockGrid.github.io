## Hello,

I'm an aspiring cybersecurity professional transitioning from a background in sales management, bringing strong communication, analytical thinking, and problem-solving skills to the digital security space.

My focus is on Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) ‚Äî helping organizations identify, assess, and manage cyber risk while aligning with frameworks and regulatory standards. I'm currently developing hands-on skills with frameworks like NIST CSF, ISO/IEC 27001, and CIS Controls, and building a portfolio of risk assessments, policy documentation, and compliance processes.

My goal is to contribute to secure and resilient operations through practical, business-aligned cybersecurity governance.

## Portfolio in Progress

1. [**NIST CSF Risk Assessment**](./portfolio/NIST%20CSF-Based%20Risk%20Assessment.md)
   A mock cybersecurity risk assessment based on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. Includes a defined scope, risk register, impact analysis, and mitigation plan for a fictional organization.
   Demonstrates structured risk evaluation and control recommendation skills.

2. [**Cybersecurity Policy Suite**](./portfolio/Cybersecurity%20Policy%20Suite.md)
   A set of customized cybersecurity policies based on SANS templates, tailored for a fictional company. Includes policies such as Acceptable Use, Incident Response, and Access Control.
   Emphasizes clarity, enforceability, and alignment with best practices.

3. [**Control Mapping Exercise**](./portfolio/Control%20Mapping%20Exercise.md)
   A control mapping project aligning security controls from a chosen framework (e.g., NIST 800-53 or ISO 27001) to fictional business processes. Includes a detailed mapping table, gap analysis, and remediation recommendations.
   Demonstrates control identification and audit readiness.

4. [**Compliance Checklist & Simulated Audit Report**](./portfolio/Compliance%20Checklist%20%26%20Simulated%20Audit%20Report.md)
   A sample compliance readiness checklist (e.g., SOC 2 or ISO 27001) with implementation status, evidence tracking, and control references. Includes a mock executive audit summary.
   Highlights documentation and compliance tracking capabilities.

5. [**Business Continuity Plan (BCP)**](./portfolio/Business%20Continuity%20Plan%20%28BCP%29.md)
   A fictional BCP for managing critical business functions during a cyber or operational disruption. Includes RTO/RPO definitions, recovery strategies, and communication plans.
   Showcases operational resilience and continuity planning.

6. [**Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA)**](./portfolio/Privacy%20Impact%20Assessment%20%28PIA%29.md)
   A privacy impact assessment for a fictional system handling sensitive personal data. Documents data processing activities, associated risks, and recommended mitigations.
   Demonstrates privacy risk awareness and compliance alignment (GDPR/CCPA).

7. [**GRC Controls Library**](./portfolio/Controls%20Library%20Spreadsheet.md)
   A spreadsheet-based controls repository aggregating key security controls from multiple frameworks (NIST, ISO, CIS). Categorized by control objective, implementation notes, and business process relevance.
   Provides a reusable reference for control mapping and audits.

8. [**GRC Case Study & Incident Scenario**](./portfolio/GRC%20Case%20Study%20Writeup.md)
   A fictional scenario inspired by real-world security events. Includes incident summary, risk implications, and policy/control updates.
   Designed to show industry awareness and the ability to respond to evolving threats from a GRC perspective.
