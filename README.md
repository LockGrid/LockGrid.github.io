## Hello,

I'm an aspiring cybersecurity professional transitioning from a background in sales management, bringing strong communication, analytical thinking, and problem-solving skills to the digital security space.

My focus is on Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) ‚Äî helping organizations identify, assess, and manage cyber risk while aligning with frameworks and regulatory standards. I'm currently developing hands-on skills with frameworks like NIST CSF, ISO/IEC 27001, and CIS Controls, and building a portfolio of risk assessments, policy documentation, and compliance processes.

My goal is to contribute to secure and resilient operations through practical, business-aligned cybersecurity governance.
