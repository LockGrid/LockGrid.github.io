Add a short document or slide deck:


What to include:

Org chart or flow of GRC structure (e.g., Security Committee, Privacy Officer, CISO)

Roles/responsibilities matrix (RACI format works great)

Policy management lifecycle:

Draft â†’ Review â†’ Approval â†’ Communication â†’ Review Cycle

ðŸ§© This demonstrates strategic GRC thinking beyond just tactical tasks.
