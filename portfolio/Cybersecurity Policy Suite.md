Summary:
A set of customized cybersecurity policies (e.g., Acceptable Use, Incident Response, Access Control) based on SANS templates and adapted for a fictional organization. Each policy includes purpose, scope, responsibilities, and enforcement terms. Highlights policy writing and regulatory alignment skills.

Access Control or Identity Governance Policy

Current Status: ✅ Partially addressed

You mentioned an Access Control Policy as part of the Cybersecurity Policy Suite. If it includes:

User provisioning/deprovisioning

Privileged access controls

MFA requirements

…then this gap is closed.

✅ Action: Just confirm these sections exist in your Access Control Policy.
If not, consider adding a standalone, more detailed policy for Identity and Access Management (IAM).
